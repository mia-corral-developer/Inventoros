    | main_file is require_once'd at activation time. Anyone with the
    | manage_plugins permission can perform this — meaning an admin
    | account compromise becomes server RCE.
    |
    | This flag controls whether the upload endpoint is reachable at all.
    | When false (the default), POST /admin/plugins/upload returns an
    | error without writing anything. Operators who want plugin uploads
    | must set INVENTOROS_ALLOW_PLUGIN_UPLOADS=true and accept the
    | residual risk documented in SECURITY.md.

    | Plugin signature verification
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Uploading a plugin is RCE-by-design (see above). Beyond the off-by-default
    | flag, an operator can require uploaded plugins to carry a detached Ed25519
    | signature verified against a trusted public key — so only plugins signed
    | by a key the operator controls (or an Zellia-published registry key)
    | can be installed, even by a compromised admin session.
    |
    | This is OFF by default: there is no public Zellia plugin registry yet,
    | and requiring signatures unconditionally would make the (already opt-in)
    | upload feature unusable for local plugin development. When `required` is
    | on it FAILS CLOSED — uploads without a valid signature are rejected. The
    | detached signature is produced with `php artisan update:sign <plugin.zip>`
    | (same Ed25519 scheme as release signing) and supplied in the `signature`
    | upload field.
